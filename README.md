# CS-305

1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
   - Artemis Financial is a financial consulting firm that deals with individual plans for their clients and works with large amounts of sensitive data. Our purpose was to develop software applications to secure the sensitive and financial data of their clients.
  
2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
   - Identifying the current vulnerabilities through static testing helped pick out any issues that could have destroyed the company's reputation. Static testing is essential for the detection and correction of coding errors.
  
3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
   - At first, the dependency check proved to be difficult but once I was able to successfully run it and physically see the vulnerabilities. The dependency checks allowed us to identify which version of the library we are using.
  
4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
   - In the future, it will become essential to conduct penetration testing as a means of thoroughly evaluating vulnerabilities.

5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
   - In case new dependencies were introduced, it became imperative to rerun the dependency check. Otherwise, functionality can be assured through unit testing and manual code review.

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
   - I used a lot of internet research and other tools such as StackOverflow and researched certain practices and algorithms that were helpful.
  
7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
   - I would show Project 2 because it involves multiple tasks related to encryption, certificate generation, secure communications, testing, and vulnerability assessment.
